# Algodoo-stuff
I am new to github and do not know how to use it. 

# Scripts that I always use
Title says all. I share my favorite scripts.

# Breaking down slime
I simulate rain using a collision glitch, which helps scatter water, and the rain breaks down a piece of gum.

# Sparkler
I found an interesting glitch that I cannot explain and it made a beautiful sparkler.

# Volcano
I simulate a volcano, that functions like a fountain. It is also able to throw rocks.

# Cool light
Using a moving ball, it separates white laser beam into two different color of laser beam when touching the white laser beam.

# Cool 3
I made cool dancers.

# Missing piece puzzle.
I test two different missing piece puzzles. I was able to find how the puzzle tricks us, without using the physical puzzle.

# Rainbow
I make a rainbow with addCircle and a glitch that makes geoms grab speed very quickly.

# Wave box
I simulate beach waves with water and objects on the beach, like a rope, sticks, and circles.
