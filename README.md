i do not know how to use github

- Scripts that I always use
title says all.

- Breaking down slime
I simulate rain using a glitch and the rain breaks down a piece of gum.

- Sparkler
I found an interesting glitch that I cannot explain and it made a beautiful sparkler.

- Volcano
I simulate a volcano, that functions like a fountain. It is also able to throw rocks.

- Cool light
Using a moving ball, it separates white laser beam into two different color of laser beam when touching the white laser beam.

- Cool 3
I made cool dancers.

- Missing piece puzzle.
I test two different missing piece puzzles. I was able to find how the puzzle tricks us, without using the physical puzzle.

- Rainbow
I make a rainbow with addCircle and a glitch that makes geoms grab speed very quickly.

- Wave box
I simulate beach waves with water and objects on the beach, like a rope, sticks, and circles.
